# File Transfer with Auto-Expiring Download Links

A simple and file-sharing system where users can upload a file and generate a unique download link that automatically expires after a selected time. All files are encrypted and stored safely, and deleted automatically after expiry.








## Features

Secure File Uploads – Uploaded files are encrypted before being stored.

Auto-Expiring Download Links – Each file is assigned a unique download link that automatically expires after the chosen time.

Client-Side Countdown Timer – Users can see a live countdown until the link expires.

Automatic File Deletion – Files are removed from the database once expired, keeping storage clean.

No File Storage on Server Disk – Files are processed in memory and stored only as encrypted bytes.

Copy-to-Clipboard Link Button – Users can easily copy the generated download link.

Clean & Modern UI – Uses a glassmorphism-styled interface with glowing buttons.

Simple & Lightweight – No login, no unnecessary steps—just upload, get link, and share.

Error Handling – If a link is invalid or expired, a dedicated “Expired” page is shown.
